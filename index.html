                    Root looked a bit shellshocked there. Who can blame him? He can only carry his team so far. And the support he's been seeking hasn't been forthcoming. There was never any doubt about England's batting order being a huge concern, and today was just a shambles. But on the flip side, they're up against an attack that doesn't give an inch. Away victories have become a more frequent occurrence for India of late, but this one has its place up there. So much to unpack, just on Day 5 itself. Do make sure to check everything our correspondents have to offer. We'll take your leave for now. It's a goodbye from Sagar Chawla on behalf of Nikhil Jadhav, KAD, MS Ramakrishnan and Siva. Phew!

                    <p>This bloke breathes fire. He's young and he's intense. Just the kind Kohli loves. There's no question of lack of effort from Siraj. And in this game he was hunting in pairs. Got Sibley and knocked over Hameed next ball. Two in the same over. And then when the going was tough for India in the second innings. He was at it. Moeen and Buttler were frustrating India with their stay. Time was running out for Kohli and Co, who were going through a wicketless phase for 15 overs with light fading. Then came Siraj. Beat Moeen's edge four times in the previous over, before finally finding one in the next. He got Sam Curran next ball to be on a hat-trick for the second time in the game. This changed the game completely. India believed again. Buttler then dropped a solid anchor. Just 9 overs left, two wickets left and Siraj came back to get Buttler and Anderson, two wickets in one over for the third time in the game. Eventually finished with a 4-fer in each innings. Troubled Joe Root umpteen times with his nipbackers in the first innings too. The whole-hearted cricket in Siraj was indeed a treat to watch!</p>
